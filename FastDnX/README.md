# FastDnX

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-red.svg)](#python)

This repository contains examples of using the FastDnX method to explain GNNs. In addition, we provide examples of using explanation conversion functions (node to edge level, and edge to node level). We also provide examples of how to calculate the fidelity of an explanation generated by FastDnX. Note that these functions are easily extended to any kind of explanation method (i.e. PGexplainer, GNNexplainer, PGMexplainer, DnX).
